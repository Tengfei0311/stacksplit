StackSplit is a plugin for the MATLAB toolbox SplitLab (Wüstefeld et al., 2008) which allows to apply multi-event techniques for shear wave splitting measurements (SWS) directly from within the main program. 

StackSplit allows to apply up to now four stacking schemes for already existing single SWS splitting measurments 




1) SIMW: simultaneous inversion of multiple waveforms in timedomain (Roy et al. (2017)

2) WS  : stacking of error surfaces, normalized on minimum of each single surface (Wolfe & Silver, 1998)

3) RH  : modified WS method with weight depending on SNR of each measurement (Restivo & Helffrich, 1999)

4) def : stacking of error surfaces without weighting following e.g. PhD thesis of Wüstefeld (2007)
